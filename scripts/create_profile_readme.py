## A collection of open source or public domain samples deployed using github pages

Each repository is resulting from an automated process to:

- Convert audio files to .ogg (opus) and .m4a (aac) formats.
- Create a files.json with the list of files for each folder
- Create a instruments.json with the list of folders with samples

No other changes are made to the original samples or packages.

Kudos for all _samplerists_ and sample creators out there! ðŸ™Œ

If you know a sample bundle with an open source license and want to include here, please open an [issue](https://github.com/smpldsnds/.github/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/smpldsnds/.github/pulls)
